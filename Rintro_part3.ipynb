    "> So far all the functions we've seen have been all on one line. As we're learning more functions and stringing them together, however, some of our lines are going to get really, really long. Breaking up a line can help make your code easier to read. (Easy to read is good! The person who's most likely to need to read your code in the future is you after you've forgotten everything about about it. Make future you's life a little easier.)\n",

    ">In text, you need to do wrap lines between words, or between syllables of words with a hyphen (-) in between. This lets the reader know that the word continues in the next line. For R, some of the \"hyphens\" that let the computer know that your line continues on the next line are the comma (,), the pipe (%>%) and the plus sign (+), which we'll talk about later. If you split your line directly after one of these characters, R knows to keep looking for the rest of the code one the next line.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You should also indent any wrapped lines after the first. This isn't necessary, but it makes your code easier to learn.  You can do this either by hitting TAB once, or space four times. (There are a lot of arguments on-line about which is better, but both work.)"
