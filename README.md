Hi there! This repo has four notebooks and two data files. This repo are for your reference & records, we're going to be working together on Kaggle so you don't have to download anything.

## Introduction

R is a programming language for statistical analysis and visualization. Using R, you can take raw data and understand the trends and patterns in it. You can also use R to create customizable, professional-looking visualizations.

This tutorial will help introduce you to the R programming language. I'm not going to assume any programming background for this tutorial.

## Learning goals:

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to do the following things. (Don't worry if you don't know what all these things are yet; we'll get there together!)

* Be familiar with basic concepts: functions, variables, data types and vectors
* Load data into R
* Summerize your data
* Graph data
