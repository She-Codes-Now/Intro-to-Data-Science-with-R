    "As you get more comfortable with R, you're probably going to want to explore this programming language more. Below, I've collected some resources you might find helpful, and some handy tips that I've found valuable. Good luck and have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The tidyverse documentation can be found here: http://www.tidyverse.org/\n",
    "* I've found these books to be very helpful and clearly written. (And also very free, which doesn't hurt!). They've by Hadley Wickham, who designed and wrote many of the tidyverse packages, including ggplot:\n",
    "  * [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\n",
    "  * [Ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://ggplot2.org/book/)\n",
    "  * [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)\n",
    "* If you're interested in text analysis or Natural Language Processing, I would recommend the excellent tidytext package. The book is available for free [here](http://tidytextmining.com/).\n",
    "* If you'd like to work with R locally on your personal computer, I would recommend using the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) integrated development environment. You can work with R in your command line/console, but RStudio is like a word-processor program for code. It has a lot of nice features that make it nicer and simpler to write R code.\n",
    "* The R community is very active and welcoming. [This blog post](http://www.burns-stat.com/r-and-social-media/) has a good overview of places you can look to find help (and new friends!). \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some handy tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you get an error message you can't figure out, **copy the text of the error and Google it** to see if anyone else has had the same problem. 99 times out of 100 you'll find that someone else has already come up with a solution!\n",
    "2.  **Double-check your capitalization**. I find that a good 20% of my errors are because I've mis-capitalized something.\n",
    "3.  **Read the documentation**! Remember that you can quickly pull up the documentation for a certain function by putting a question mark in front of the function name and then running the command. \n",
    "4. If you're not sure how to start approaching a problem, **start by writing out all the steps you want your code to do in English** (or your language of choice). Then turn each step into a separate comment in your code and write the code to do that step underneath it. Not only will it help you organize your thoughts, but your code will also be nicely commented when you're done.\n",
    "5. Remember that you put the arguments for a function in parentheses (), and you get data from inside an object using square brackets []. **someText() is a function, someText[] is an object**: if you try to pass arguments to an object you'll get an error.\n",
    "6. If you're not sure why a data_frame isn't acting the way you expect it to, **str() is a good place to start figuring out what an object is behaving in a surprising way**. You'd be surprised how often I've found out that what I thought was a data_frame ended up being something else entirely!\n",
    "7. **Remember not to put special characters in names**. In general, the only non alpha-numeric character you want to use in a name is a period (.) or underscore (\\_) between words to make it easier to read. You can find a handy style-guide [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). (You don't have to follow a style-guide, but it makes it easier for other people to read your code.)\n",
    "8. **You can keep certain lines of code from running but putting a hashtag/pound sign (#) in front of them** to turn them into comments. This is called \"commenting out\" code, and it can be really helpful if you're trying to figure out which lines are generating which errors.\n",
    "9. Once you start typing a part of R code, like the name of a variable or a function, **you can complete words in your code automatically by pressing the TAB key**. If there's more than one valid completion, a list of possible completions will drop down. This is really handy when you want to see all your geom options, for example.\n",
    "10.  **Read other people's R code**. I've learned a lot of handy tips over the years from seeing how other people do things. On Kaggle, you can find R code by going to [the kernels page](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) and filtering for kernels written in R.  \n",
